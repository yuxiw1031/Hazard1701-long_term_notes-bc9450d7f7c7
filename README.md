# My project's README

## The git process
1. git pull (pull from origin master to get the most updated version of code)
2. Do add/modify/delete.
3. git add .  (set the changed files to be the "will be committed" status)
4. git commit -m "commit message" (commit message should briefly summarize what you have done for this commit)
5. git push origin master (push your changes to the remote master branch)


## If you want to add to new chapter:
\include{Chapter_name} ## A new tex file called Chapter_name.tex will be created.

## This is a learning repository for fans of Mr. Jin Yong. Thus there would be a quote from his book before every chapter(hopefully).
